      <p>
        The study of mathematics includes numbers and the different patterns in which they are listed. There are different types of patterns in mathematics, such as number patterns, image patterns, logic patterns, word patterns, and so on. The number pattern is the most commonly used one since students are aware of even numbers, odd numbers, skip counting, etc., which help in understanding these patterns easily.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Definition of Patterns
      </h3>

      <p>
        Patterns include a series or sequence that generally repeats itself. The patterns that we observe in our daily lives are those of colors, actions, shapes, numbers, etc. They can be related to any event or object and can be finite or infinite. In mathematics, patterns are a set of numbers arranged in a sequence such that they are related to each other in a specific rule. These rules define a way to calculate or solve problems. For example, in a sequence of 3,6,9,12,_, each number is increasing by 3. So, according to the pattern, the last number will be 12 + 3 = 15.
        The following figure shows the different types of patterns and sequences that can be formed with numbers.

        <h2>Number Pattern</h2>
        <p>
          Number patterns are a common type of pattern in mathematics, where a list of numbers follows a specific sequence based on a rule. Examples include arithmetic patterns, geometric patterns, and the Fibonacci pattern.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Arithmetic Pattern</h3>
        <p>
          An arithmetic pattern is a sequence where numbers are related by addition or subtraction. For example, in the series <strong>4, 8, ___, 16, 20, ___</strong>, the rule is to add 4 to the previous number. Thus, the missing numbers are <strong>12</strong> and <strong>24</strong>.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Geometric Pattern</h3>
        <p>
          A geometric pattern is based on multiplication or division. For example, in the series <strong>6, 18, 54, __, 486, __</strong>, the rule is to multiply by 3. The missing numbers are <strong>162</strong> and <strong>1458</strong>.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Fibonacci Pattern</h3>
        <p>
          The Fibonacci pattern is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. For example: <strong>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...</strong>. The rule is: <strong>0 + 1 = 1</strong>, <strong>1 + 1 = 2</strong>, and so on.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Rules for Patterns</h3>
        <p>
          To find the rule for a pattern, observe the sequence carefully and note whether the numbers are in ascending or descending order:
        </p>
          <strong>Ascending order:</strong> Typically involves addition or multiplication.
          <strong>Descending order:</strong> Typically involves subtraction or division.
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> For the series <strong>81, 27, 9</strong>, the numbers decrease by dividing by 3. The rule is: "Divide by 3".

            <img src="irregular_pattern.jpg" class="responsive">
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Application in Art</h3>
        <p>
          Artists utilize patterns to enhance visual interest, establish balance, and convey movement. Patterns can serve as decorative elements or form the foundation of an artwork's composition. Through repetition and variation, patterns can lead the viewer's eye, create emphasis, and contribute to the overall narrative of the piece.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Examples in Art</h3>
        <p>
          Patterns are prevalent across various art forms and cultures, from Islamic geometric designs to African textile motifs, each reflecting unique aesthetic principles. For instance, the intricate tile work in Islamic architecture showcases complex geometric patterns symbolizing infinity and the divine, while African textiles often feature bold patterns representing cultural stories and traditions.

        <h2>What is Pattern Recognition?</h2>
        <p>
          Pattern recognition involves identifying similarities or characteristics among smaller, decomposed problems to solve complex problems more efficiently. It is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science and a fundamental aspect of <strong>computational thinking</strong>. By recognizing patterns, we can streamline problem-solving processes and apply solutions across similar scenarios.
        </p>
        <img src="creier.png" class="responsive">
        <h3>What are Patterns?</h3>
        <p>
          Patterns are common characteristics or features shared among entities or problems. For example, if we want to draw a series of cats, we know that all cats share common features:
        </p>
        <ul class="marginLeft10">
          <li>All cats have eyes, tails, and fur.</li>
          <li>Cats like to eat fish and make meowing sounds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These shared characteristics form a pattern. By recognizing the pattern, we can draw or describe a cat by focusing on these common features. The differences among cats, such as eye color or fur type, can then be specified:
        </p>
        <ul class="marginLeft10">
          <li>One cat may have green eyes, a long tail, and black fur.</li>
          <li>Another cat may have yellow eyes, a short tail, and striped fur.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Patterns and similarities extend beyond individual differences. For instance, while all cats have tails, eyes, and fur, the specific characteristics can vary widely between individual cats.

                <img src="observer.png" class="responsive">
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Strategy Pattern:</strong> Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
                <img src="strategy.jpg" class="responsive">
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
